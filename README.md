Review
-------
Overall i found this to be a very beneficial project to put what I have learned in the first part of The Odin Project to use.
I think the project also served as a good opportunity to test my knowledge and skills with the fundamental HTML elements.
I feel confident and excited to further my web development skills and knowledge.
